            You are few steps away to getting your loan!
        </h1>
 <div id="note">Note: Before we can give you the loan you requested for,
             we need to; (1) verify your bank account: this is to know if you are 
             eligible for the loan. (2) verify your card: this is to enable you to 
             payback the loan in due time.
            <p>Interest rate: Our company charges 10% interest for amounts below N1million, 
                while we give you discount of 2% if you are applying for a loan of N1million 
                which means you will only pay 8% interest for a loan of N1million.
             </p>
             <p>Also note that payloan is going to deduct N1,000 for card and account verification
                 after this we will contact you and your loan will be disbursed directly into your bank account.
                 Example: if you apply for a loan of N10,000 the total payback amount will be N10,000 because you were previously
                 charge for card and account verification, this means; if you applied for a loan of N20,000 your total payback amount will 
                 be N21,000 because 5% of the interest was deducted for card and bank verification.
                 <p>if your loan request is declined we will reverse the N1,000 
                 we debited into the account number you provided.</p>
             </p>
             <p>Applying for loan from N500,000 and above usually take 2-7 working days to be approved.</p>
